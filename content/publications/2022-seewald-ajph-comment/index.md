abstract: "A comment on [Wang and Chakraborty (2023)](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2022.307135) in which I argue that adaptive interventions have the potential to lead us towards a vision of public health that is more responsive to changing needs, and call for methods work to adapt the sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial to settings that require rapid response."
