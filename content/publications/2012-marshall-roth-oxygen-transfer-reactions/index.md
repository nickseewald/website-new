abstract: "Mechanistic studies indicate that the oxomolybdenum(VI) bis(3,5-di-*tert*-butylcatecholate) fragment deoxygenates pyridine-N-oxides in a reaction where the oxygen is delivered to molybdenum but the electrons for substrate reduction are drawn from the bound catecholate ligands, forming 3,5-di-*tert*-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone."
